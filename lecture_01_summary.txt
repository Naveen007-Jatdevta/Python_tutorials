## 1st lecture ##

1. Variable
    - how to declare    (eg: a = 12)
    - print()           (how print statement works)
    - datatypes:
        - string, int, float, bool


2. variable naming culture:  (HOW BEAUTIFULLY WE CAN ASSIGN VARIABLE NAME)
    - camel case -> myVar = 10
    - pascal case -> MyVar = 10
    - snake case -> my_var = 10


3. typecasting
    - int(12)    -> 12
    - float(12)  -> 12.0
    - str(12)    -> '12' / "12"



4. contraints ka error, what was the reason behind it?
"WHY STRING WAS EXPECTING ALL THE INPUT FROM USER INCLUDING INT AND FLOAT"?
a = str(input("Enter Value: "))  --> this was takking int, str, float also without any error, why?


*Solution*:

a = int(input("Enter value: "))
print(a)

    - when user insert a value using input("Enter value: ") the
    value automatically gets stored in 'string' format.

    - then int() which you are using outside the input(), is actually
    working as typecasting,

        - In some cases like for int and float it is working as constarint
        like we were expecting in our lectures but plz keep in the 
        back of the mindthe error these int and float is generating 
        is not because of it is a constrait but because of typecasting.
         

    ""NOTE" 

    a = int(input("enter value:")) also can be written as:

    [or]
    
    a = input("enter value")   ---> asking user to insert value
    a = int(a)                 ---> type casting user input into int format
