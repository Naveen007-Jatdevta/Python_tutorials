# Problem Solution in class:
"""
Q1. Write a python program for a situation say:
 	- Ask user for a positive number, If the number is positive then:
 		- if the number is divisible by 2 then:
			print('It is divisible by 2')
 		- similar do check for if the number is divisible by 
        (3, 4, 5 and 7).
	
 	- But if the user input number is a negative number then:
 		 print('User plz enter a positive number')
	
 	- Also don't forget to check for zero.
