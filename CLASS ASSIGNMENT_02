Q: Build a python program that performs following:


Step 1: Bulid a Dictionary consisting of:

    keys as 1, 2, 3, 4
    values as "Hello", "People", [12, 32, "loss", "Maximum"], " Hello world!! this is an exclusive system designed to work over emebedded systems... "

    Take these keys and values from users as userinput. (Using WHILE LOOP)



Step 2: Now after building the dictionary perfrom following operations:

    (A): On Key 3 -> Print first 3 elements of the list
                    - Using Slicing
                    - and also by for loop

    (B): On Key 3 -> Do remove elements named as "loss".

    (C): On Key 3 -> Do remove all the elements from list and then finally update it into the dictionary. (So after this operation dictionary will contain an empty list).

    (D): On key 4 -> Do perform striping of whitespaces if it exists.

    (E): On key 4 -> Do perform splitting and remove element("e") from the string and then convert list of string back to proper string.
