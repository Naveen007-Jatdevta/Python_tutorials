CLASS-WORK

Q1. Take 10 users age (age should be between the range of 12 to 40), 
sort the age of the user in a ascending order and then perfrom 
backtracing to finally print the sorted age in descending order.

Note: In this question you are not at all allowed to use any of the 
backtracing shortcuts (that means cannot use reversed(), a.reverse()
and not even a[::-1]).

Please Design your own backtracing algorithm for this particular
problem statement.

Hint: Use your brain, concept are already done in the class just
      need to apply those concept here in this question.
