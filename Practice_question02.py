Q1. Make Dictionary using both the methods and store in dict_01 make dictionary of 10 items/elements
[take dict_01 key values from user input]


Q2. Access the dictionary dict_01
    - accessing anyone value of the dict_01 from the both the methods.

    - getting all values of the dictionary 
    - getting all keys of the dictionary


Q3. Changing dictionary dict_01 items(or Updating) 
    - Changing anyone item via both the methods.


Q4. Adding item in the dictionary dict_01:
    - Adding the item via new key and assign value to it, do this by both the methods.


Q5. Remove item from the dictionary dict_01:
    - Removing the anyone item via all the 3 methods thought in the class.
      
    - Clear the complete dictionary via both the methods thought in the class.


Q6. Loop:
  - loop for all keys in the dictionary dict_01. 
  - loop for all values in the dictionary dict_01.

""" TUPLE """

"""
Q1. Making a Tuple using both the methods and store it in tup_01
[Take elements of the tuple from User input]


Q2. Access last 5 elements from the tuple tup_01 and print it.


Q3. Perform this operation:

step-1. Take the last 3 elements of the tup_01 convert that element into string and store it your appropriate place seperatly.[either you want to store it as tuple / list / variable its your choice]

step-2. concatenate the above selected 3 elements with the string "_100X". (name this 3 elements as myValue)

step-3. Now make a dictionary with key named as 'key1', 'key2', 'key3' and assign each of them values of myValues.
        
        Example:
        myValue = ['mo_100X', 'pet_100X', 'pl_100X' ]
        
        dic = { 
            'key1' : 'mo_100X', 
            'key2' : 'pet_100X',
            'key3' : 'pl_100X'
            }

step-4. Print all the element of the final dictionary using FOR-LOOP.
