Q. Make a python program to:

1. Take two string sentences from the user input 
and store it in the variable "mString" and 
"mString2". [MAKE SURE THE STRING LENGTH SHOULD BE 
GREATER THAN 7]


2. Pefrom concatiantion operation with over 
mString and mString2.


3. Pefrom slicing of firt 5 elements from the 
mString2.


4. Print string '*' 10 times using string 
operation [don't use print('*') with FOR LOOP].


5. Strip the elements of the mString from 
leading and beginning.


6. Split the elements of the mString 
(splitting should be word by word).


7. Loop each character of the string and 
print it.


8. Replace the characters in the string.


9. print the mString sentence characters 
seperatly in the list.


10. join the list of the string charaters(letter)
 using .join().


11. Split the mString into list of seperate 
strings characters(NOTE not to seperate by words) 
and then again merge them into string of sentence 
into orginal form.


12. Print this pattern using String opertion not
 by previous multiple looping method.
